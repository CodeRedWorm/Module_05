# Module_05

Create matrix 'A'
A <- matrix(1:100, nrow=10)

View matrix 'A'
A

Calculate determinant of matrix 'A'
det(A)

Since the determinant of matrix 'A' is 0, then the matrix is singular and does not have an inverse.


Create matrix 'B'
B <- matrix(1:1000, nrow=10)

Since matrix 'B' is not a square matrix, it's determinant and inverse can't be calculated.
